The contract is based on OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and Ownable contracts.\n2. It has a maximum supply of 1 million tokens.\n3. The initial supply is 100,000 tokens, minted to the contract deployer.\n4. Only the owner can mint new tokens using the `mint` function.\n5. Users can burn their own tokens using the `burn` function.\n6. The token has 18 decimals, a name of \"MintingToken\", and a symbol of \"MTK\".\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The max supply and initial supply are set arbitrarily and can be adjusted as needed.\n- Only the owner can mint tokens, which might not be suitable for all use cases.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract, which will mint the initial supply to the deployer's address.\n2. The owner can mint additional tokens using the `mint` function, specifying the recipient address and amount.\n3. Token holders can transfer tokens using the standard ERC20 `transfer` function.\n4. Token holders can burn their own tokens using the `burn` function.\n\nRemember to review and adjust the contract parameters (like max supply, initial supply, token name, and symbol) according to your specific requirements before deployment.\n",

Here's a summary of what I did:\n\n1. Implemented a struct to store user data and a large dynamic array to hold multiple users.\n2. Created a mapping to track user balances.\n3. Implemented functions that perform gas-intensive operations:\n   - addMultipleUsers: Adds multiple users at once, which can be costly for large arrays.\n   - performComplexCalculation: Performs calculations on all user data, which can be expensive for a large number of users.\n   - updateAllBalances: Updates balances for all users, which can be gas-intensive for many users.\n   - simulateExternalCall: Simulates external calls to multiple addresses, which is gas-heavy.\n   - processLargeArray: Processes a large array with mathematical operations, which can be very gas-intensive.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract assumes that user IDs can be converted to valid Ethereum addresses in the updateAllBalances function.\n2. The simulateExternalCall function assumes that the target contracts have a 'ping()' function.\n3. Some functions might hit the block gas limit if processing very large amounts of data.\n\nInstructions for deployment and interaction:\n1. Deploy the contract using a wallet with sufficient gas.\n2. As the owner, you can add users, update balances, and perform complex calculations.\n3. Be cautious when calling functions with large arrays or when the contract has many users, as gas costs can be very high.\n4. Ensure that any address used in simulateExternalCall is a valid contract address with a 'ping()' function.\n\nPlease note that this contract is designed to be gas-intensive and may not be suitable for production use without optimization.\n",

Keeping the existing functions (performComplexCalculation, processLargeArray, and getContractBalance)\n\nI've implemented proper error handling, gas estimation with a safety buffer, and retry logic for RPC connection issues. The component checks for wallet connection and correct chain before each interaction.\n\nPlease note that the admin functions (addMultipleUsers and updateAllBalances) are accessible to anyone using this interface. In a production environment, you should implement proper access control on the frontend to restrict these functions to authorized users only.\n\nThe users data for addMultipleUsers should be entered as a JSON array of objects, each containing id, name, and score properties. For example:\n[{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Alice\", \"score\": 100}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Bob\", \"score\": 200}]\n\nFor the simulateExternalCall function, enter the addresses as a comma-separated list.\n\nRemember to handle the events emitted by the contract if you want to display more detailed information about the transactions.\n",

Implemented staking, unstaking, and reward claiming functions.\n2. Added view functions to check staked balances and pending rewards.\n3. Included an updateReward function to calculate and update rewards for users.\n4. Implemented owner-only functions to set the reward rate and withdraw unused rewards.\n5. Added events for staking, unstaking, and claiming rewards.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract uses placeholder addresses for staking and reward tokens. These should be changed to actual token addresses before deployment.\n- The initial reward rate is set to 0.001 tokens per second per staked token. This can be adjusted using the setRewardRate function.\n- The contract assumes that the reward token balance in the contract is sufficient to pay out rewards. Ensure to keep it funded.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder addresses for stakingToken and rewardToken in the constructor with actual ERC20 token addresses.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that users approve the contract to spend their staking tokens before calling the stake function.\n4. As the owner, make sure to keep the contract funded with reward tokens.\n5. Users can stake tokens, unstake them, and claim rewards using the respective functions.\n6. Monitor the emitted events to track staking, unstaking, and reward claiming activities.\n",
